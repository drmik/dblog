# Hi there!!!!!

My name is Khalil and I'm the author of this blog.

I am a research scientist, a programmer, and a wantrepreneur. Amongst other things, I have built products, earned degrees, worked as a consultant and a university-level teacher but now my interests lie in the intersection of data, code and creative problem-solving.

This blog will serve as an avenue for sharing my experiences with the world. I will post articles, quotes, links, videos and any information that is useful to me --- perhaps you may benefit from it as well.

Some of this blogâ€™s content might be a work-in-progress, accidentally wrong, or even strongly opinionated (duh!). But if you find anything of it to be interesting, then please share it with world. Otherwise, let me know how I can make it better for everyone.

Salaam!
